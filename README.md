# A simple generated blog template using using Next.js, MDX, Tailwind CSS and TypeScript

This template was made on top of the existing [blog-starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) template.

This example showcases Next.js's [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) feature using Markdown files as the data source.

The blog posts are stored in `/_posts` as Markdown files with front matter support. Adding a new Markdown file in there will create a new blog post.

If you are using the template it will be great if you create a PR and add your blog to this list in readme file. It will motivate us to create more such projects.
